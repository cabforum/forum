**Forum IPR Subcommittee Charter**

Upon approval of the CAB Forum by ballot, and in accordance with section 5.6 of the CA/Browser Forum Bylaws, the Forum IPR Subcommittee ("FIPR") is created to perform the activities specified in this Charter, subject to the terms and conditions of the Bylaws, which take precedence over this Charter. 

**1. Definitions**

Definitions found in the Bylaws or in the IPR Policy shall apply to capitalized terms in this Charter.

**2. Scope**

The primary activity of the FIPR shall be to review and propose revisions to the Forum’s IPR Policy, IPR Policy Agreement, and Exclusion Notice Template ("Deliverables").     Discussion will include:

(a) How to address contributions provided by non-Forum Members (e.g., invited experts, guest speakers, researchers, etc.);

(b) If any clarifications and/or changes are necessary to the IPR Policy in view of recent events; and

(c) A potential contributor license agreement for the Forum’s GitHub repository and policy for contributing to the Forum’s GitHub repository.

The FIPR may perform other activities ancillary to this primary activity. The FIPR will not adopt Final Guidelines or Final Maintenance Guidelines.

**3. Chairs and Contacts**

The proposer of the ballot adopting this Charter, Ben Wilson, will act as organizer of the FIPR until the first teleconference is held for the FIPR, at which time the FIPR will elect a chair and vice-chair, either by vote or by acclamation of those present.

**4. Participation**

The FIPR welcomes the participation of any Forum Voting Member interested in this work. Voting Members initially declaring their participation in this Subcommittee are: Amazon, Apple, DigiCert, GoDaddy, Google, HARICA, Let’s Encrypt, Mozilla, and Sectigo.

**5. Communication**

The FIPR will communicate primarily through listserv-based email and shall conduct periodic calls or face-to-face meetings as needed.

**6. End Date**

The FIPR will submit its Deliverables to the Forum prior to October 1, 2024, and upon such date the Subcommittee is deemed dissolved.
