#### 1.1 **Summary of Working Group Goals and Objectives** 

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group shall establish and specify a list of capitalized terms, with associated definitions, used within the context of work by the Forum. In order to ensure the Definitions and Glossary Working Group may define all terms relevant to the Forum, this Working Group’s scope includes the terminology used within each Chartered Working Group or Subcommittee within the Forum. The Definitions and Glossary Working Group shall not establish Normative Requirements, nor specify how defined terms are or may be used within documentation produced by other Chartered Working Groups. The existence of a certain term, defined by the Definitions and Glossary Working Group, shall not impede or limit the ability for any Chartered Working Group to provide its own definition for the same term.

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group shall produce a Final Guideline representing a set of capitalized terms and their definitions used within the CA/Browser Forum. This Final Guideline shall be produced with the intent that it may be incorporated by other Chartered Working Groups, as applicable to the scope of the various Guidelines produced within each Chartered Working Group.

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group shall maintain its published Guideline as needed to incorporate additional defined terms, to modify extant defined terms, or to remove defined terms which are no longer necessary.

### **3. Membership**

#### **3.1 Membership Criteria and Application Process**

This Working Group shall have the following categories of membership: Certificate Consumer, Certificate Issuer, Associate Member, and Interested Party.

Applicants must be members of the CSCWG, the SMCWG, or the SCWG, and may join the Definitions and Glossary Working Group only with such status or class as they hold in such other Chartered Working Groups.

In accordance with the IPR Policy, Members that choose to participate in the Definitions and Glossary Working Group must declare their participation and class of membership prior to participating. The Chair of the Definitions and Glossary Working Group shall establish a mailing list for use by the Working Group, including for declarations of participation, and manage it in accordance with the Bylaws, the IPR Policy, and the IPR Agreement. A Member must declare its participation in the Definitions and Glossary Working Group on the Working Group’s mailing list.

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group shall include Interested Parties and Associate Members as defined in the Bylaws.

#### **3.2 Voting Structure**

The Working Group shall consist of two classes of voting members: Certificate Issuers and Certificate Consumers 

In order for a ballot to be adopted by the Definitions and Glossary Working Group, two-thirds or more of the votes cast by the Certificate Issuers must be in favor of the ballot and more than half of the votes cast by the Certificate Consumers must be in favor of the ballot. At least one member of each class must vote in favor of a ballot for it to be adopted. Quorum is the average number of Member organizations (cumulative, regardless of Class) that have participated in the previous three Definitions and Glossary Working Group Meetings or Teleconferences (not counting subcommittee meetings thereof). For transition purposes, if three meetings have not yet occurred, quorum is ten (10).

#### **3.3 Ending Membership**

Members may resign from the Working Group at any time through a message to the Working Group’s mailing list. Resignation does not prevent a Member from potentially having continuing obligations, under the Forum's IPR Policy or any other document.

Votes cast before a Voting Member's resignation is announced will stand.

### **4. Dependencies and Liaisons**

#### **4.1 CAB Forum Groups**

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group shall coordinate with, and seek guidance from, the following other CA/Browser Forum Chartered Working Groups, as needed or applicable: 

* Code Signing Certificate Working Group;
* Network Security Working Group;
* Server Certificate Working Group; and
* S/MIME Certificate Working Group.

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group may coordinate with, or seek guidance from, other CA/Browser Forum Chartered Working Groups or Subcommittees as deemed appropriate by the Working Group.

#### 4.2 **External Groups** 

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group shall coordinate with, and seek guidance from, the following external organizations, as needed or applicable: 

* Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF);
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO); and
* World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group may coordinate with, or seek guidance from, other external organizations as deemed appropriate by consensus within the Working Group.

### **5. Participation**

To be successful, the Definitions and Glossary Working Group is expected to have 14 or more active participants for its duration. The Working Group participants are expected to contribute an appropriate number of hours per week towards the Working Group’s activities.

### **6. Communication**

Most Definitions and Glossary Working Group Teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis. The Working Group conducts its work primarily on the Definitions and Glossary Working Group mailing list, which is available to the public. Information about the group will be available via the CA/Browser Forum website ([https://cabforum.org](https://cabforum.org/)).

### **7. Decision Process**

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus and with due process. The expectation is that, typically, the Chair or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with the Working Group participants, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required. However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chair(s) should put the question out for voting within the WG (using email and/or web-based survey techniques) according to Section 2 (Forum Membership and Voting) of the Forum Bylaws and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.

### **8. IPR Policy**

The Definitions and Glossary Working Group is subject to the CA/Browser Forum Intellectual Rights Policy v.1.3 Effective July 3, 2018 (the “IPR Policy”). To promote the widest adoption of the CA/Browser Forum Guidelines, CA/Browser Forum seeks to issue Final Guidelines and Final Maintenance Guidelines that can be implemented, according to the IPR Policy, on a CA/Browser Forum Royalty-Free License basis. For information about exclusion of Essential Claims, see Section 4 of the IPR Policy.
